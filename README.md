A SQL database containing Montgomery County, Maryland crime statistics such as the address of occurence, type of crime, responding agency, and more. 
This database was constructed with a target audience of current or incoming MoCo residents in mind.
Crime statistics can affect both feelings of personal safety and property values, influencing a person's decision to live in the area.
The sample views showcase a few ways that the database could be used for analysis, including average crime response times by district, total crime incidents per city, etc.

The dataset used to populate the database was cleaned and trimmed for relevance, but the original source can be found here: https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime/icn6-v9z3/about_data
